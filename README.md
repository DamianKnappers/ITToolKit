# ITToolKit
Simple toolkit filled with handy shortcuts and misc tools in a C# forms

Basically a small project to get back into C# again. 
I will try to keep it updated and make it so it actually has a use case. 
Been a IT guy myself and know that some settings / tools are being placed deeper and deeper in the systems as the "new gui" of Windows keeps updating.

Currentl Plans:
- Easy access to tools like TeamViewer, CCleaner, Malwarebytes Anti-Adware and much more
- Process Analysis (heavy running processes and formatting them in lists with easy kill features
- Automated faster boot
- Internet tools like IP Settings, DNS, bottleneck detection
- Browser Extension tools (Not sure if this will be automated or listed with easy download feature)
- Easy click access to windows build-in settings
- Bulk image collection (Will collect all png's for example and place them ordered in a folder)
- Lost text feature, this will scout the entire drive and find the text file with the string you supplied / file name you supplied (Of course string search will take longer)
